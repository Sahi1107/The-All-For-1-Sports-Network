## What's Done vs. What's Left

### ✅ DONE

#### Infrastructure & Mobile
- Full monorepo setup (npm workspaces, concurrently for single `npm run dev`).
- PostgreSQL installed locally and running; full schema tracking with Prisma.
- Mobile App support implemented via Capacitor (iOS & Android compilation ready via Native IDEs).
- E2E API tests completed for key workflows like registration, login, and profile fetching.

#### Backend
- Advanced Security: `helmet`, bot protection algorithms, comprehensive `winston` traffic logs, and full schema boundary checks using `Zod` validation middleware.
- Full Email Lifecycle Setup: Accounts generate email links via `Nodemailer` for user-verification and forgotten-password reset scenarios cleanly encoded utilizing cryptographic algorithms (`crypto.ts`).
- Auth system with JWT access + refresh tokens, bcrypt, RBAC middleware.
- User profiles with Cloudinary avatar upload.
- Fully baked Feed structures relying on Connections, Posts, and Highlight sharing functionalities.
- Teams and Tournament participation flows.
- Automated statistics computation for the Platform Rankings table relying on dynamic rules.
- Real-time Notifications & Live Messaging streams using pure Socket.IO implementations.

#### Frontend & UI
- Cross-platform codebase functional on Web, iOS, and Android formats utilizing Tailwind CSS.
- Complete Multi-step onboarding flow (Login, Register: info → role → sport).
- Email UI capabilities: "Verify Email", "Forgot Password", and "Reset Password" built into distinct interactive Pages.
- Dynamic layouts tailored specifically exactly to user Roles (Admin dashboards distinct from regular Athlete usage).
- Complete capabilities for managing user highlights, organizing teams, viewing sports tournaments, and participating in global rankings.

### ⬜ REMAINING / PLANNED

#### Required Before Public Launch
- **Cloudinary credentials** — Ensure production keys are stored securely in a cloud-hosted environment to support Cloudinary API ingestion properly at scale.
- **Build & Deploy Process** — Deploy production services to cloud host (Vercel/Render/Railway) alongside production postgres environment.

#### Advanced Features (In Progress & Future)
- **AI-Enhanced Rankings** — The underlying tracking for data accumulation is complete. Next tasks involve: implementing incremental learning algorithms to continuously improve scoring rules, adding player clustering capabilities for tracking unique athlete archetypes, and spotting statistical outlier performances automatically using ML anomaly detection logic.
- **Video player component** — Moving away from direct string uploads in Cloudinary into an inline playback UI featuring functional Web video controls.
- **Admin Match result UI Form** — Create frontend forms that allow organizers to efficiently append single-match scoring inputs, accelerating the global tournament ranking calculators immediately upon completion.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL running locally (installed via `brew install postgresql@16`)
- Cloudinary account (for video/image uploads)

### Setup
```bash
# Clone and install all dependencies
npm install

# Edit server/.env to use your correct PostgreSQL URL, Cloudinary API configuration, and SMTP setup details.

# Generate tables
cd server && npx prisma db push
```

### Development (Web)
```bash
# From root — starts both server and client concurrently
npm run dev
```

### Development (Mobile Apps)
```bash
cd client
npm run build
npx cap sync       # Copies web assets to native mobile project folders
npx cap open ios   # Opens Xcode to build and run iOS app
npx cap open android # Opens Android Studio to build and run Android app
```

### Ports
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:3001
- API routes: http://localhost:3001/api/*
- Vite proxies `/api` and `/socket.io` to the backend automatically
